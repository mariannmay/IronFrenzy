Space Apps Competition - "No Delays" air traffic

Possibilities:
TODO: Debug!
TODO: User-friendly interface
TODO: Visualization of routes
TODO: More realistic airoport operation 
TODO: more realistic calculation of fuel consumption (different speeds & take altitude into account)
TODO: take weather prediction

Basic outline: 
routes are described as sequence of waypoints
assume shortest path (on sphere)
in set_sim_form set routes and scheduled times
assume each aiport has two runways
assume taking off/landing takes 10 minutes
output: time (with delays) & fuel consumption
